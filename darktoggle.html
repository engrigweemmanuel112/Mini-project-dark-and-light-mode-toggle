      <h2>Welcome to Our Web Application</h2>
      <p>This is a sample web page that demonstrates how to switch between dark and light modes using JavaScript.</p>

      <p>
        Objective: Create a web application that demonstrates DOM manipulation techniques using JavaScript by creating a
        templating system that changes the styles of the web page from a dark mode to a light mode based on the users
        interactions.
      </p>

      <h2> Instructions:</h2>

      <h3>1. Setup the Project Structure:</h3>

      <p>
        Create a new folder for your project.
        Inside the folder, create the following files:
        index.html: This file will contain the HTML structure and content of your webpage.
        styles.css: This file will contain the CSS styles for your webpage.
        script.js: This file will contain the JavaScript code for DOM manipulation.
      </p> <br /> <br />

      <h3>2. Create HTML Structure:</h3>
      <p>
        Open index.html.
        Decide what type of web application you would like to build.
        Some examples could include:<br /> <br />
        A hospital reporting system user interface.
        A local business directory web application.
        A blogging website web application.
        A data analysis visualisation user interface.
        A modern gaming website that displays gaming news articles.
        Define the basic structure and add content to your webpage.
        Link the styles.css and script.js files to your HTML.
        Styling:<br /> <br />
      </p>

      <h3> Open styles.css.</h3>
      <p>
        Define styles for light mode and dark mode, ensuring proper contrast and readability.
        An alternative would be to have two different color schemes, fonts or other template styles (Example a gaming
        page that switches from a fun pink mode to a neon cyber punk style.)
        Define all the styles for the sections of the page in the two modes.
